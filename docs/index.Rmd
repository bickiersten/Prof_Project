## Introduction

For my project, I decided to complete two different analyses on topics that I am passionate about. The first analysis, which can be found below, is where I collected data for many different movies. The second analysis, which can also be found below, is where I created a weather predicting model, in which I collected three years of weather data for Idaho Falls, Idaho.

View each analysis by following the links below:
